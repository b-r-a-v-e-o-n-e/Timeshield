Timeshild is a script that allows a certain OpenWrt interface to be turned on or off at a set time.
I wrote the script with the purpose of limiting the time spent on the Internet by my children.
Script tested with OpenWrt versions 21.xx, 22.xx, 23.xx (added version OpenWrt 19.07.x)
There is a basic log function, as well as the ability to monitor the size of the log file 
according to a set parameter for the size in kilobytes, when this size exceeds the limit set in the script, 
the log will be deleted and recreated.
